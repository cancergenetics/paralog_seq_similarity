## Evaluating Sequence and Structural Similarity Metrics for Predicting Shared Paralog Functions

This repository contains the data processing, dataset construction, analysis code, and feature evaluations for the paper titled: **Evaluating Sequence and Structural Similarity Metrics for Predicting Shared Paralog Functions**, currently *in preparation*.

The main datasets, along with some example of computed paralog pair features, can be found in the `./data` directory. All datasets, labels, and predictions are fully available on: [https://zenodo.org/records/14973633](https://zenodo.org/records/14973633)



### Sequence similarity features computing overview:

Scripts in `./compute_features` are used to compute all sequence similarity features presented in the paper, for human and yeast paralog pairs, including metrics such as sequence identity, alignment scores, and other relevant features.

> [!WARNING]
> They require external softfware (e.g., Foldseek) and databases (e.g., AF-DB).

### Main data processing and analysis notebooks overview:

Main notebooks used to build the four datasets (PPI-SL X Yeast-Human), analyze their contents, explore the relationships between the features, and evaluate the predictive power of individual and combined features on these datasets.
